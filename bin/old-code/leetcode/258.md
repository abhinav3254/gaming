# Digital Root Calculation

The digital root, also known as the repeated digital sum, of a non-negative integer is the single-digit value obtained by summing the digits of the number until a single-digit number remains.

For example, let's consider the number 12345:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
1 + 5 = 6

So, the digital root of 12345 is 6.

## Digital Root Formula Explanation:

Given a non-negative integer `num`, we aim to find its digital root using a mathematical formula.

1. If `num` is zero, its digital root is 0 (dr(0) = 0).
2. For any other positive integer `num`, the digital root `dr(n)` can be calculated using the formula:

   dr(n) = 1 + ((n - 1) % 9) if n > 0

This formula involves the modulo operation `%`, which returns the remainder of a division operation.

### Breakdown of the Formula:

- `n - 1`: Subtracting 1 from the number `n`.
- `(n - 1) % 9`: Taking the modulo of `(n - 1)` by 9. The result of this operation will be between 0 and 8.
- `1 + ((n - 1) % 9)`: Adding 1 to the result of the modulo operation. This ensures that the final digital root value is in the range from 1 to 9.

The reason for using modulo 9 in this formula is that the digital root of any number `n` is equal to `n % 9`, except when `n` is divisible by 9 (i.e., `n % 9 == 0`). In such cases, the digital root should be 9, not 0.

### Examples:

- The digital root of 18: 1 + (18 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 17 % 9 = 1 + 8 = 9
- The digital root of 27: 1 + (27 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 26 % 9 = 1 + 8 = 9

This formula provides a quick and efficient way to compute the digital root of a number without explicitly summing its individual digits, making it useful in various applications involving repeated digital sum calculations.
